            Mining for bitcoin generates substantial electronic waste that "represents a growing threat to the
            environment", according to a recent study. A co-author of the report told AFP on Friday that the
            average life cycle of the powerful computers used to unearth the units of the world's leading
            <a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/finance/crypto-currency-price-in-india-inr-compare-bitcoin-ether-dogecoin-ripple-litecoin">cryptocurrency</a> was only 1.3 years.

            Alex de Vries noted that this was "extremely short compared to any" other electronic devices such
            as iPhones. At 30,700 tonnes, the amount of electronic waste generated by <a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/finance/bitcoin-price-history">bitcoin</a> mining in the
            12 months to May was "comparable to the amount of small IT and telecommunication equipment
            waste produced by a country like the Netherlands", the report said.

            The race to find new bitcoins -- on Friday, one unit was worth more than $47,000 following a
            stellar rise this year -- means the mining computers' processing power soon becomes obsolete.

            And the more bitcoin is worth, the larger the amount of electronic waste, according to the study
            published by scientific journal, Elsevier.

            Alex de Vries works as an economist at the Dutch central bank, while the report's co-author
            Christian Stoll is from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

            Despite the high amount of waste, it remains a fraction of the global total from throwing away
            electronic devices, which stood at 53.6 million tonnes last year.
